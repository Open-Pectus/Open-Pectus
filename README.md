# Open Pectus
Pectus is a process control system for Unit Operations such as filtration, chromatography, precipitation, solubilization and refolding. Pectus implements a language called P-code which is used to write methods and control components on the Unit Operation.

General documentation about case, architecture and P-Code is available at [Read the Docs](https://open-pectus.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

Documentation for developers is available in the [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md) file.
